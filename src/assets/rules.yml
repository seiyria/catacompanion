- name: Basic Shots
  children:
    - name: Melee
      pretext: > 
        A melee shot is the most basic shot type.
        <br><br>
        It is performed by shooting the appropriate
        piece with the controlling player’s finger
        across the board and is meant
        to simulate a hero or monster charging into
        battle. An unmodified melee shot does one
        point of damage. 

    - name: Rush
      pretext: >
        A rush shot is performed exactly like a melee shot; however, no damage
        is inflicted. The shot’s name suggests haste, thus
        there is no opportunity to engage in hand-to-hand combat. 

- name: Ranged Shots
  children:

    - name: Boulder
      pretext: >
        The boulder shot is a powerful ranged shots
        that function identically to the missile shot; however, the
        appropriate side of the large, orange piece is shot instead. 

    - name: Fireball
      pretext: >
        A fireball shot is a ranged shot type that
        behaves the same as a missile shot except
        the fireball piece is shot instead. 

    - name: Giant Fireball
      pretext: >
        The giant fireball shot is a powerful ranged shots
        that function identically to the missile shot; however, the
        appropriate side of the large, orange piece is shot instead. 

    - name: Ice
      pretext: >
        Ice shots are a ranged shot using the ice shot piece.
        <br><br>
        When a character is struck by an ice shot, it does not take any damage
        but is considered to be frozen. Place the ice shot piece on top of the
        affected character piece. If multiple targets are hit by an ice shot the
        player performing the shot decides which one will be frozen.
        <br><br>
        While frozen, a character cannot take any actions, does not take
        damage and any of their defensive properties are suspended. They
        must remain in place on the board with the ice shot piece placed on top
        of them. A frozen character can only be freed when the ice shot piece
        is knocked off by another shot, either directly or indirectly (the ice shot
        piece is immediately removed from the board).
        <br><br>
        Heroes must be careful not to knock the ice shot piece off a frozen
        monster. If all other monsters in a room are dead and any remain
        frozen, the room is complete and the heroes move on to the Resolution
        Phase. The player who froze a monster collects gold the same way they
        would if it had been destroyed.
        <br><br>
        Catacomb Lords and Antients are not affected by the ice shot.

    - name: Missile
      pretext: >
        For example, a missile shot indicates that a missile
        piece is used instead of the character piece itself and
        represents an arrow being fired or a spell being cast. A
        missile shot piece is placed anywhere within 2.5cm (1”)
        of the character and then shot across the board. 
        <br><br>
        It inflicts one point of damage if it hits a target and
        is removed from the board when completed. 

    - name: Shield
      pretext: >
        A shield shot functions identically to the missile shot, but a
        shield piece is shot instead. This shot represents the character
        pushing an enemy away with their shield and does no damage.
        Directly after the character’s turn is finished (all other
        shots in their shot sequence are completed), the shield piece
        is repositioned to any legal location on the game board within
        2.5cm (1”) of the shield’s owner to help protect them.
        <br><br>
        Shield pieces are removed from the board when their owner
        dies or when the Battle Phase ends.

    - name: Target
      pretext: >
        The target shot is a ranged shot that functions like a missile shot, but a player can shoot a second
        time if the first shot misses. The target character must be declared prior to shooting the first shot (place the Target
        token on that character). If a player misses the target character, a second shot may be attempted from the last legal
        position where the first shot ended. The target shot inflicts one point of damage to the stated target only; damage to
        other characters is ignored.
        <br><br>
        The Target token is then removed.

- name: Shot Modifiers
  children:
    - name: Chain
      pretext: >
        The chain shot modifier indicates
        that the same target cannot be
        damaged consecutively in a shot sequence and does not
        appear in combination with any other shot modifier. If the
        same target is hit twice consecutively, damage that would
        have been inflicted by the second hit is ignored.
        <br><br>
        For example, if Xoric the Barbarian plays the Berserker
        Battle Axe Item card, he can perform four melee shots in
        a row; however, they cannot damage the same monster
        or Catacomb Lord consecutively. Therefore, the Barbarian
        could hit a Zombie (destroying it), then hit a Troll (it is
        damaged and flips over in place on the board), then hit a
        Fire Spirit (destroying it) and then hit the same damaged
        Troll again (finally destroying it).
        <br><br>
        By preventing damage being applied consecutively, the
        chain shot modifier ensures that damage from a particular
        shot sequence is distributed across several targets.
        Ranged shots with the chain modifier always originate
        from the location of the character performing them.

    - name: Corrosion
      pretext: >
        If a hero is hit
        with a corrosion shot modifier, one of their Item
        cards is destroyed. The player shuffles the affected
        hero’s Item cards. One Item card is drawn randomly and is
        discarded from the game. Any pieces associated with it on
        the board are removed. If the affected hero does not have
        any items, then this modifier has no effect. 

    - name: Critical
      pretext: >
        The critical
        shot modifier increases the damage
        inflicted by the base shot by one point

    - name: Fear
      pretext: >
        The fear shot
        modifier forces an affected character to
        lose their courage and run away. The attacker who damages
        a target with the fear shot modifier, may immediately
        perform a single, unmodifiable rush shot with the affected
        hero (including those that are stunned), ally, familiar or
        monster piece. 

    - name: Petrify
      pretext: >
        When a character
        is hit with the petrify shot modifier, they are
        turned to stone. The character is dead and are
        removed from the board, no matter how much health they
        have remaining. If multiple characters are hit, only one is
        affected by the petrify shot modifier (all characters still
        take damage). The player performing the shot decides
        which one is turned to stone.

    - name: Poison
      pretext: >
        Some monster attacks not
        only result in loss of health
        points, but are also poisonous. When a hero is hit by
        a poison shot modifier, they first must decrease their
        health by one point (if applicable). he appropriate number
        of Poison cards are then drawn from the Poison deck
        and placed face up on the affected hero’s player mat.
        As they are damaged by poison shots, the Poison cards
        accumulate.
        <br><br>
        If at any time, the total value of all the Poison cards
        accumulated equals or exceeds the starting health of that
        hero, then they are overwhelmed by the poison and die. 

    - name: Regeneration
      pretext: >
        Regeneration is when health is stolen
        from an enemy. The regeneration shot
        modifier enables a character to restore one point of health
        after successfully damaging an enemy. Only one point of
        health is restored even if multiple targets are damaged.
        A character can never exceed their maximum starting
        health.
        <br><br>
        For example, a Troll that is already in the damaged state
        successfully damages Elani the Thief with its regeneration
        melee shot. The Thief suffers one point of damage and the
        Troll’s piece is flipped back over to its normal state because
        it has regained one point of health. Another example,
        Varesh the Wizard has three health points. He plays a
        Drain Energy Spell card and performs a missile shot with
        the regeneration modifier against a Zombie. The Zombie is
        destroyed (it lost one health point) and the Wizard’s health
        is increased by one to four. The regeneration shot modifier
        is ineffective against Antients and shadow monsters

    - name: Stun
      pretext: >
        Shots with the stun modifier
        leave the affected hero
        temporarily able to only perform a single rush shot. Place
        the Stunned! card over the affected hero’s Rules card. On
        their turn, a player may only perform a single rush shot
        with a stunned hero until that hero is hit directly by any
        melee or rush shot from one of their teammates (including
        another stunned hero). Remove the Stunned! card when
        this happens.
        <br><br>
        When the Battle Phase for a room ends, all stunned
        heroes return to normal and players remove all Stunned!
        cards.
        <br><br>
        If a hero is stunned and has a familiar in play, 
        the player controlling the hero can still perform
        the familiar’s action.
        However, in the case
        of the Raven Familiar,
        no spells can be cast
        from its location while
        its owner is stunned.
        <br><br>
        If only a single hero
        is able to perform
        their normal action(s)
        during the Battle
        Phase (the others may
        be dead, devoured
        or teleported), the
        effects of the stun
        modifier on
        that hero are ignored.

    - name: Transform
      pretext: >
        When a
        monster with the transform shot modifier
        inflicts damage, it transforms into the form
        indicated below the shot sequence.
        <br><br>
        Only one monster can perform this type of modified
        shot: the Fire Spirit. After the Overseer performs this shot
        and damages one of the Heroic Forces, the Fire Spirit piece
        is flipped over and becomes a fire wall. It remains in this
        form for the remainder of the room and is treated like an
        obstacle. Thus fire walls cannot be controlled further by
        the Overseer and do not count as monsters in the room.
        <br><br>
        As a burning sphere of flame, it will inflict one health
        point of damage to any of the Heroic Forces who come into
        contact with it in any way: directly or indirectly. If a fire
        wall is pushed off the board, return it to the point where
        it departed as normal.

- name: Shot Mitigation
  children:
    - name: Nullification
      pretext: >
        Some characters can nullify basic shots
        which prevents any damage from being inflicted and any
        shot modifiers taking effect (the modifiers are ignored).
        For example, a Skeleton Warrior monster has a missile
        shot icon in its Nullifies box. This means that it won’t suffer
        any damage from any basic missile shot or any modified
        missile shot (including the critical modifier). To destroy
        the Skeleton Warrior, the heroes could use a melee shot
        or fireball shot.
        <br><br>
        Marorg the Skeleton Explorer’s Hero Rule card has a
        Nullifies box that contains poison melee, poison missile
        and poison rush shot icons. Marorg is only protected
        from being damaged (and therefore poisoned) by these
        modified shots specifically. 

    - name: Reflection
      pretext: >
        Reflected shots behave the
        same as those that have been nullified with
        the exception that one (and only one) point
        of damage is reflected back at the attacker
        initiating the shot. For example, the Minotaur
        can reflect missile shots. If a player shoots
        a missile shot against it, that missile shot is
        nullified and one point of damage is reflected
        back at the attacking hero.
        <br><br>
        When a Nullifies or Reflects box appears on an Antient
        card, a Catacomb Lord Rules card, a Hero Rules card, a
        Monster card or Item card with the frequency condition
        of “permanent” (see page 18), no action is required on
        the part of the player, as all shot icons in that box will be
        nullified and/or reflected automatically.
        <br><br>
        When a Nullifies or Reflects box appears on an Ability
        card or Item card with the “Once per room” frequency
        condition, then the player affected by a given shot may
        choose when to use the card to be protected from the shot
        icons in the box. The card is flipped over and is refreshed
        (flipped face up) during the Setup phase of the next room.
        <br><br>
        Finally when a Nullifies or Reflects box appears on a
        Spell card or Item card with the “Once per game” frequency
        condition, then the player affected by a given shot must
        choose when to use the card to be protected from the shot
        icons in the box, after which the card is discarded.

    - name: Suppression
      pretext: >
        Suppression is a condition where a character is
        prevented from performing a certain type of shot and/
        or modifier in some rooms. This is expressed on a Room
        card by the icons for the suppressed shots being listed
        in a Suppresses box. If an unmodified shot is listed, that
        means that shot type and all its modified versions are
        suppressed for the duration of that room. For example,
        if an unmodified missile shot is listed in the Suppresses
        box, that means no missile shots modified or unmodified
        can be performed by either the Heroic Forces or the
        Overseer. Critical missile shot modifiers, chain missile
        shot modifiers, poison missile shot modifiers, etc. are
        all suppressed too. If a specific modified shot is listed,
        only the modifier is suppressed, not the basic shot.
        For example, if a stun missile
        shot modifier is listed in the
        Suppresses box only the stun
        modifier is suppressed. This
        would mean that the Overseer,
        when controlling the Crypt
        Spider monster, would treat it as
        having unmodified missile shots
        in its shot sequence as opposed
        to those with the stun modifier.

- name: Special Shots
  children:
    - name: Bite
      pretext: >
        When hit by a bite shot, one point of
        damage is immediately inflicted as normal to any
        affected targets. For all characters that remain alive,
        the player chooses one and places a Bite Token on top
        of it.
        <br><br>
        A character that has been bitten cannot take
        any actions and can only be freed when the Bite
        Token is knocked off by another shot, either directly
        or indirectly. When this happens, the Bite Token is
        immediately removed from the board.
        <br><br>
        A player must be careful not to knock the Bite Token
        off accidentally, freeing an affected character. If at the end
        of the next round the Bite Token has not been knocked
        off, another point of health is deducted from the affected
        target. One point of health is lost at the end of every
        further round that the bite shot piece stays in place.
        <br><br>
        Stunned heroes are unaffected by the Bite shot.

    - name: Devour
      pretext: >
        When hit by a devour shot,
        the hero, ally or familiar immediately takes one point of
        damage. If they are still alive, they are removed from the
        board and placed on the Devoured! card. While fighting for
        life in the monster’s stomach, a character that has been
        devoured cannot take any actions and are considered to
        be removed from the game.
        <br><br>
        All devoured characters are released once the room
        is completed successfully or the monster is destroyed. In
        the latter case, all characters are returned to the place
        on the board where the monster was destroyed, ready to
        take their turn as normal. If multiple characters are hit
        by a devour shot, all take damage; however, only one is
        devoured: the Overseer decides which one will be sent to
        the Devoured! card.
        <br><br>
        Multiple characters
        can be placed on the
        Devoured! card at the
        same time, but each one
        has to be hit by a separate
        devour shot.
        <br><br>
        When a character is
        devoured, the effects of
        the stun shot modifier and
        the bite shot are cancelled.
        Characters cannot
        be teleported off the
        Devoured! card.

    - name: Open Portal
      pretext: >
        During the Battle Phase, a hero or Catacomb Lord
        can open a Magic Portal to switch the positions of any
        two characters on the board (including themselves).
        <br><br>
        This includes allies and familiars. Unlike teleportation,
        no pieces leave the board, their positions (including any
        conditions) are simply switched. For example, Elani the
        Thief only has one point of health left and is surrounded by
        monsters. Vysara the Sorceress (from the Cavern of Soloth
        expansion) uses her Open Portal
        Ability card to switch the position of
        the Thief and Xoric the Barbarian. A
        player may only switch the positions
        of two of their own teammates: a
        hero cannot change positions with
        a monster and a Catacomb Lord
        cannot change positions with a hero.

    - name: Repeat
      pretext: >
        During the Battle Phase, when a monster or Catacomb Lord hits a monster with a
        repeat shot, that monster may take another turn. 

    - name: Roll
      pretext: >
        The roll shot is performed by
        placing the character piece on its side,
        and rolling it across the board. In order
        to inflict damage, the rolling character
        must make contact with an enemy
        target when it comes to a complete stop,
        either hitting or partially covering another piece. In the
        latter case, ensure the character that performed the roll
        shot finishes the shot laying flat in a legal location on the
        board. If a rolling character leaves the board, simply place
        it back on the edge of the board (laying flat) at the point
        where it left as normal.
        <br><br>
        An unmodified roll shot does two points of damage. If
        two characters are hit by a roll shot, only one is affected:
        the player performing the shot decides which one.

    - name: Runic Shift
      pretext: >
        The character performing a Runic
        Shift (including Antients, Familiars,
        and Wyverns) is picked up from their
        current location and moved to any
        unoccupied Rune Location icon on
        the game board. Afterwards, execute
        a Melee shot with that character.

    - name: Summon
      pretext: >
        Summon shots enable new characters to
        be brought into play during the Battle Phase. A summon
        shot is performed in the same way as other ranged shot
        except that the character piece (for example, a monster or
        Antient) specified in the shot sequence of the summoning
        character is used instead.
        <br><br>
        This initial shot represents the summoning process and
        is treated like a standard ranged shot that inflicts one point
        of damage (regardless of any other shots the character
        being summoned may have in its shot sequence).
        <br><br>
        After the character performing the summon shot has
        completed its full sequence, the summoned character can
        be controlled as normal.
        <br><br>
        In the case of monsters specifically, the monster piece
        being summoned must be available from the Monster Pool.

    - name: Teleport
      pretext: >
        During the Battle Phase, a
        character can be teleported,
        enabling them to be removed
        from the game board and
        then returned to a different
        location on their next turn.
        <br><br>
        A character will execute
        a teleport as part of a shot
        sequence and the target
        character being teleported
        will have its piece removed
        from the board and placed
        on the Teleported! card.
        <br><br>
        During the next round
        of the Battle Phase, the
        teleported character must
        come back into play. The
        player places its piece
        anywhere along the edge
        of the game board and
        performs a single melee
        shot. This melee shot can be
        followed with a post-Combo
        item, if desired. This is
        the end of the teleported
        character’s turn during that round of the Battle Phase.
        For example, Varesh the Wizard
        uses the Teleport Hero Spell card to
        leave the board. His wooden piece
        is placed on the Teleported! card. In
        the next round, he is returned to the
        edge of the game board and performs
        a single melee shot.
        <br><br>
        While on the Teleported! card,
        a character cannot be damaged or
        killed.
        <br><br>
        The act of teleporting helps characters recover from
        being stunned, bitten and frozen: bite and ice shot pieces are
        immediately removed. If all other heroes are dead and one
        remains on the Teleported! card, that hero may teleport
        back onto the board and continue fighting.
        <br><br>
        The same is true for monsters and Catacomb Lords. This
        implies that the Battle Phase continues while monsters
        and/or Catacomb Lords are on the Teleported! card and
        none remain on the board itself.
        <br><br>
        A character who is stunned, bitten or frozen cannot
        teleport themselves. However, they can be teleported by
        another character. A character must be teleported back
        into play on their next turn.
        <br><br>
        No combat occurs between any monsters and heroes
        that are on the Teleported! card at the same time.

- name: Template Shots
  pretext: >
    When using the Short, Long, and Spread templates, place
    the end with the black circle over the top of the character
    using it. A template may be positioned in any direction
    across the game board and away from the character. Once
    the player has fixed the direction of the template, then they
    check to see if any opposing characters are covered by it,
    either partially or completely. Damage and the effects of
    any modifiers are then applied to all affected characters.
    <br><br>
    Characters that are on the same team are unaffected by
    templates, as per normal rules related to friendly fire.

  children:
    - name: Short
      pretext: >
        This template has no special rules.

    - name: Long
      pretext: >
        For the Long template, only characters that are partially
        or completely covered from the curved dotted line to the
        end of the template are affected.

    - name: Spread
      pretext: >
        This template has no special rules.

    - name: Ring
      pretext: >
        The Ring template does not have a black circle and
        simply affects all targets covered by it (again partially or
        completely).

- name: Monster Health
  children:
    - name: Normal
      pretext: >
        Creatures with no special health modifier simply take damage and get destroyed when it reaches 0.

    - name: Shadow
      pretext: >
        Shadow monsters (such as the Phantom) emerge from
        the Shadow Realm, the space between the board and walls.
        Instead of a solid blood health drop icon on their Monster
        cards, they have a dotted one as shown to the right.
        <br><br>
        In order to be destroyed, shadow
        monsters must be pushed completely off
        the game board by any direct shot (rush,
        melee or a ranged shot) from the heroic
        forces.

    - name: Invulnerable
      pretext: >
        Antients are invulnerable, and cannot be damaged, destroyed, or afflicted with any status effects.

    - name: Reanimation
      pretext: >
        The Shambling Mound monster
        cannot be permanently destroyed by
        the Heroic Forces. When killed, it is
        immediately placed on the back edge of
        the Monster Start Zone by the Overseer.
        Shambling Mounds do not count as monsters for the
        purposes of determining when a room is complete.

- name: Monster Families
  children:
    - name: Dungeon (Green)
      pretext: >
        Dungeon monsters are vulnerable to missile
        shots: treat any unmodified missile shot from the heroic
        forces that strikes a member of the dungeon family as
        having the critical modifier.

    - name: Infernal (Orange)
      pretext: >
        Infernal monsters are vulnerable to the ice
        shot with their health being reduced by one extra point in
        addition to being frozen (if they remain alive).

    - name: Mythological (Blue)
      pretext: >
        Mythological monsters are vulnerable in hand-to-hand combat. Treat any unmodified melee shot from
        the heroic forces as having the regeneration modifier.

    - name: Undead (Gray)
      pretext: >
        Undead monsters are vulnerable to the fireball
        shot: treat any unmodified fireball shot from the heroic
        forces as having the critical modifier. In addition, undead
        monsters are vulnerable to fire walls and fire obstacles
        (from the Cavern of Soloth expansion), taking one point
        of damage when hitting them or being pushed into them.

    - name: Vermin (Beige)
      pretext: >
        Vermin monsters that are extra small in size
        (Sewer Rats, Armoured Beetles, Pit Vipers, Vampire Bats)
        are susceptible to fear: treat any unmodified melee or
        missile shot from the heroic forces as having the fear
        modifier, unless the target monster itself has a shot with
        the fear modifier in its sequence (the Blood Skull).

- name: Special Rooms
  children:
    - name: Alewife Tavern
      pretext: >
        At the Alewife Tavern, players can test their luck to win items, regain health or be cured of poison. The Overseer
        places all the Orcs, Fire Spirits, Centaurs and four hero pieces in an opaque bag. To place a bet, a player must pay two
        gold coins. They pull three pieces from the bag and consult the following table of rewards from top to bottom to see if
        they have won.
        <br><br>
        3 Heroes - Gain full health for the chosen hero and their ally (if he or she has
        one) OR cure all Poison cards assigned to one hero.
        <br><br>
        3 of a kind - Take an Item card of your choice from the item deck.
        <br><br>
        2 Hero pieces - Blindly draw 1 Item card (player must take first item they can use).
        <br><br>
        3 different coloured pieces - Gain 1 health point OR cure 1 Poison card.
        <br><br>
        1 Hero piece - Gain 1 gold coin from the Treasury.
        <br><br>
        Replace the pieces in the bag before placing another wager. Each player
        can bet as many times as they like, as long as they have sufficient gold to do
        so. Players may pool their gold in order to place a wager. Players indicate
        which hero is gambling for each wager and only that hero wins any rewards
        which are paid out and applied immediately. Winning players may choose a
        reward that is lower on the table than the one they qualified for. All gold lost
        by the heroes is returned to the Treasury. 

    - name: Altar of Soloth
      pretext: >
        The Altar of Soloth is a new Special
        Room card that can be added to the Room
        card layout before the Catacomb Lord’s
        Lair card. When the heroes arrive at the
        Altar, they may choose to pay five gold
        coins (one Hero may pay or they may pool
        their gold). The Overseer shuffles the deck
        of Item cards and flips over the top card.
        As a group, the heroes decide if they want
        to accept that item. If they do, they must
        assign the Item card to one Hero. If the
        group does not want, or cannot use that
        item, it is returned to the bottom of the
        deck. They may pay another five gold coins
        to make another offering and flip over the
        next Item card.

    - name: Althea the Healer
      pretext: >
        Althea the Healer offers rest and relief to the heroes. She will
        cure one Poison card for free. As a group, the players decide which
        hero will be able to discard a Poison card and shuffle it into the
        Poison card deck.
        <br><br>
        She also enables the heroes to obtain the following services in
        exchange for an offering:
        <br><br>
        1. Heal Hero or Ally (3 Coins) - One health point is restored to the hero or ally. Move the Hero or Ally
        Tracker up the health track on the hero’s player mat by one blood drop.
        <br><br>
        2. Cure Poison (2 Coins) - A hero is cured of one Poison card.
        <br><br>
        3. Resurrect Hero (10 Coins) - One dead hero is brought back to life with two health points. The hero
        returns to life with all of his or her gold coins and any unused Item and/or
        Spell cards. They may pay to be healed further by the Healer.
        The resurrected hero starts playing in the next room.
        <br><br>
        Multiple services can be purchased from the Healer. Players may pool their gold coins in order to make offerings
        for her services. Allies can be healed by the Healer, but not resurrected.

    - name: Amaranth Inn
      pretext: >
        The Amaranth Inn allows heroes to meet and recruit an
        ally to help them. When the heroes arrive at the Inn, any
        hero that is not being used in the game may be recruited
        as an ally at a cost of ten gold coins. To do so, place all the
        unused Hero Portrait cards face down and shuffle them
        together. Randomly draw one card: this is the ally that
        may be recruited. If the players choose to proceed, they
        may pool their gold to pay the required fee to the Treasury.
        <br><br>
        One player will control the ally and
        assign it to assist one of the heroes he or
        she controls. Place the Portrait and Rules
        cards beside the appropriate hero player
        mat. Unless otherwise stated on their
        Rules card, allies have a maximum health
        of four. Use the Ally Tracker to record the
        health on the hero’s main health track.
        <br><br>
        Allies use the shot sequence printed on their Hero
        Rules card as normal. The following rules also apply:
        <br><br>
        Ability Cards: Allies start with one less of their total
        Ability cards (minimum one). The player recruiting the ally
        chooses which Ability card(s) the ally will use.
        <br><br>
        Item Cards: Allies cannot buy or use Item cards.
        <br><br>
        Spell Cards: Spell Casters may take any two Spell cards
        of their choice.
        <br><br>
        For example, Oleira the Elf starts with two Elven Arrow
        Ability cards as a hero. When she is recruited as an ally,
        she will only start with one of these cards (one less Ability
        card, minimum one) and may not use the Spirit Familiar
        item.
        <br><br>
        A second example: Varesh the Wizard starts with one
        Fireball Ability card as a hero and may choose ten Spell
        cards. When recruited as an ally, he may use his Ability
        card, but may choose only two Spell cards.
        During the Setup Phase, an ally is placed in the Hero
        Start Zone along with the other heroes. The player who
        recruited the ally takes a turn for both the hero and ally
        during each round in any order. Allies function much the
        same way as heroes: they can be teleported and devoured.
        <br><br>
        They can damage and destroy monsters and Catacomb
        Lords. When they lose all their health points, they die and
        are removed from the game. However, there are significant
        differences between a hero and an ally. Allies cannot buy or
        use items, use spells, be stunned, poisoned or resurrected.
        They cannot earn gold for destroying monsters: all gold
        transfers to the hero whom the ally was assigned to assist.
        <br><br>
        If a hero dies and their ally is still on the board, control
        of the ally passes to the hero with the lowest current health
        (regardless of maximum starting health). If two heroes are
        tied for lowest health, the hero who has the least gold of
        the two will get the ally. If there is still a tie, the hero with
        the fewest items gets the ally. 

    - name: Catacomb Lord's Lair
      pretext: >
        When the heroes arrive at the Catacomb Lord’s Lair Special Room card during the
        Exploration Phase, their final battle of the game starts. The Overseer controls the
        Catacomb Lord and its squad of minions.

    - name: Izchak the Merchant
      pretext: >
        When the heroes arrive at Izchak the Merchant during
        the Exploration Phase, they may use their gold to buy
        items to aid them in their quest. The Overseer shuffles the
        deck of Item cards and flips over six cards for the players
        to examine. These items are available for purchase or the
        players can pay two gold coins to see the next card on
        the top of the Item card deck. There is no limit as to how
        many times they may do this. Any player can purchase any
        number of the revealed Item cards provided they meet the
        requirements. Players may pool their gold coins to assist in
        the purchase of items. When an item has been purchased,
        the gold coins are returned to the Treasury. The Item card
        is assigned to the hero by placing it in the designated area
        on the hero’s player mat.

        As an additional service, a map may be purchased from
        the Merchant by any hero for two gold coins. When the
        map is paid for, all
        the Room cards
        in the catacomb
        are flipped over,
        thus revealing the
        path leading to the
        Catacomb Lord. 

    - name: Shaurath
      pretext: >
        When searching the ruins of the Shaurath crypt, the heroes discover
        items to aid them in their quest. Shuffle the deck of item cards and
        draw two. The players controlling the heroes decide which two
        members of the party will use each item (normal restrictions apply).

    - name: Secret Spring
      pretext: >
        The heroes find their way to the Secret Spring whose
        cold, clear waters offer recuperation and healing. 
        <br><br>
        Shuffle the four Spring Tokens and place them face down
        on the Secret Spring Room card. Each player draws a Spring
        Token and does either of the following:
        <br><br>
        1. Takes the full amount of health indicated on the Spring
        Token, adjusting the hero’s health track accordingly.
        <br><br>
        2. Keeps the Spring Token and discards it during the
        Setup Phase of any subsequent Battle Room. When used
        this way, some of the Spring’s potency will have diminished
        and therefore only half the value of the Spring Token may
        be converted (rounded down).
        <br><br>
        Only the hero that owns the Spring Token may use it. The
        hero’s health may not exceed its starting level.

    - name: Wyvern Nest
      pretext: >
        While making their way through a mountain pass, the
        heroes discover a giant nest with Wyvern eggs that are
        ready to hatch. In fact, one of them already has! 
        <br><br>
        Three players take an Egg Token each. The fourth player
        takes the Wyvern Familiar Item card and disc. If the Wyvern
        Familiar is already in play, the player controlling it does not
        receive an Egg Token.
        <br><br>
        During any subsequent Battle Phase,
        a player may hatch a Wyvern instead of
        taking their hero’s normal action. The
        player discards an Egg Token, chooses
        any available Wyvern from the Wyvern
        Aviary, and performs the following
        sequence with their hero:
        <br><br>
        (rush > summon wyvern > rush)
        <br><br>
        When the Egg shot ranged disc from Catacombs &
        Castles is available, the player may choose the following
        sequence instead:
        <br><br>
        (rush > egg > rush)
        <br><br>
        The Wyvern is placed on the game board as normal and
        persists for the remainder of the room.
